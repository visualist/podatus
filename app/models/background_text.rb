    The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the
    frightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
    could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends
    shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen
    ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby
    was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed
    around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the
    Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
    filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock
    Turtle.

    All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with
    the other players, and shouting 'Off with his head!' or 'Off with her
    head!' Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,
    who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by
    the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the
    players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and
    under sentence of execution.

    By the quantity of provision which I had consumed, I should guess that
    I had passed three weeks in this journey; and the continual protraction
    of hope, returning back upon the heart, often wrung bitter drops of
    despondency and grief from my eyes.  Despair had indeed almost secured
    her prey, and I should soon have sunk beneath this misery.  Once, after
    the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the
    summit of a sloping ice mountain, and one, sinking under his fatigue,
    died, I viewed the expanse before me with anguish, when suddenly my eye
    caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain.  I strained my sight to
    discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when I
    distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a well-known
    form within.  Oh!  With what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart!
    Warm tears filled my eyes, which I hastily wiped away, that they might
    not intercept the view I had of the daemon; but still my sight was
    dimmed by the burning drops, until, giving way to the emotions that
    oppressed me, I wept aloud.

    Dinner-time, and still no Hundreds of people. In the arrangements of
    the little household, Miss Pross took charge of the lower regions, and
    always acquitted herself marvellously. Her dinners, of a very modest
    quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their
    contrivances, half English and half French, that nothing could be
    better. Miss Pross's friendship being of the thoroughly practical
    kind, she had ravaged Soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of
    impoverished French, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would
    impart culinary mysteries to her. From these decayed sons and daughters
    of Gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl
    who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a Sorceress,
    or Cinderella's Godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit,
    a vegetable or two from the garden, and change them into anything she
    pleased.

    His sisters were anxious for his having an estate of his own; but,
    though he was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no
    means unwilling to preside at his table--nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had
    married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider
    his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of
    age two years, when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation
    to look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it for
    half-an-hour--was pleased with the situation and the principal
    rooms, satisfied with what the owner said in its praise, and took it
    immediately.

    Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would
    have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest Lizzy! how rich
    and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages
    you will have! Jane's is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so
    pleased--so happy. Such a charming man!--so handsome! so tall!--Oh, my
    dear Lizzy! pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before. I
    hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing
    that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,
    Lord! What will become of me. I shall go distracted.
