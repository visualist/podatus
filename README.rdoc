Podatus is data visualization for literary works, breaking down
parts of speach, showing the result in streamgraphs.

As an inchoate Rails project, the usual Rails setups can get to
the first steps toward running (rake db:migrate), but you'll also
need to seed the database. For that, a set of rake tasks in the
'book' namespace exist: find, show, load. See the data directory
for the book.json file. To load:
	<tt>rake book:load</tt>
	<tt>rake book:sentence</tt>
